    "- `-in message.txt` : The `-in` option allows us to specify the file that we want to encrypt. In our case this file is [message.txt](message.txt).\n",
    "- `-pass file:keys/symmetric.key` : The `-pass` option let's us specify which key we want to use for encryption. We let the command know that our key is in a file and that this file is called *symmetric.key* and it's in the *keys* folder.\n",
    "- `-out message.enc` : Finally, we have to tell the command where to put the encrypted version of the message. We do this with the `-out` option followed by the file name of the encrypted message, which we can call *message.enc*.\n",
